SEE BOTTOM FOR USAGE

Project description: My Health Records seeks to empower individuals to take an active role in their health care, and provide technology and service to make that easy. The focus of the product is to host secure storage of a person’s records for that person’s use, as well as provide an easy to use application to facilitate viewing, sharing and updating health records.

Sprint 2 log:
During sprint two Allen and I decided implementing the ability to send multiple files, do in browser file viewing, and delete files were the most crucial to add . We did this by using a framework called nodemailer to deal with emails and express/fs to deal with deletes/viewing.

- Send multiple Health Records feature:
  - This feature is critical to this application because in many cases a patient will need to share multiple files. The implementation of this requred some json formatting and creating custom messages for nodemailer to send

- View
  - Being able to view your records is important because it eliminates any confusion about which record is which and if it can saely be deleted from the server. 
  
- Delete Health Records feature: 
  -  Being able to delete old health records in very important to eliminate outdated records so that users know they are always sharing the most current records and being able to delete helps eliminate blotage on the server/database.
